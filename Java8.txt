main agenda of anonymous inner class we can overide a function without creating a subclass.

An anonymous class cannot have a constructor. so, there is no need to pass parameters to an anonymous class while instantiating it.
Can be instantiated only once. 
Cannot be static. 
Has no name. 



Deafault methods in interface are where implementations are there by default implemenations no need to override these methods as there will 
default logic that cant be changed.

When there are two same methods in differnt interface if a class implementing both the interface then call the default methods with interface names

for static methods in interface the methods called by the interface names.
